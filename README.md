# DES
This repo is of the Data Encryption Standard algorithm (DES), which I coded for the Dell HackTrick competition.

After I understood the algorithm through this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoLbJKh9X2A">YouTube</a> video, I used this <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/fips/46-3/final/docs/fips46-3.pdf">Documentation</a> I found online to use as a reference for all of the permutations and equations.
